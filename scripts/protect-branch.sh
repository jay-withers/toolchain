# One-time GitHub settings for this repo - the parts that can't live as files
# in the repo:
#   - repository auto-merge + delete-branch-on-merge (auto-merge is what lets
#     renovate.json's platformAutomerge actually merge PRs)
#   - a ruleset on the target branch requiring PR approval and the given CI
#     status checks, with the repo owner (admin role) and the Renovate app
#     exempted as bypass actors on both
#
# Deletes every ruleset currently on the repo before creating this one, so
# the repo always ends up with exactly the state this script defines rather
# than accumulating stale rulesets from earlier runs or manual changes made
# in the GitHub UI.
#
# Requires: gh CLI, authenticated with admin rights on the target repo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/protect-branch.sh [branch] [required-check-contexts]
#
# required-check-contexts is a NEWLINE-separated list of status check context
# names (newline, not space, because a context name can itself contain spaces -
# see below), defaulting to "pre-commit / Pre-commit".
#
# Check names must match the context a job reports on a PR. Because this repo's
# pre-commit workflow calls a reusable workflow, the reported context is
# "<caller job id> / <reusable job name>" = "pre-commit / Pre-commit", NOT the
# bare "pre-commit" - requiring the bare name leaves the check "Expected"
# forever. Confirm the exact names with: gh pr checks
#
# Note test-install's linux/macos jobs only run when src/ changes, so requiring
# them would block src-less PRs - that's why the default is pre-commit alone.
#
# Env overrides:
#   REPO               owner/name (default: current repo via gh)
#   APPROVALS_REQUIRED number of required approving reviews
#                      (default: 1 for org-owned repos, 0 for user-owned repos
#                      - see the bypass_actors note below)
#
# GitHub only honours ruleset bypass_actors (the Renovate app entry below)
# on repos owned by an organisation. On a personal (User-owned) repo, that
# entry is accepted by the API but silently has no effect: Renovate's
# platformAutomerge enables auto-merge, but the required-review rule still
# blocks it forever, since Renovate can't review its own PR and nothing else
# is exempted. There's no fix that keeps required reviews on a personal repo
# short of installing a separate auto-approve app (e.g. Mend's
# renovate-approve), so this script defaults required reviews to 0 there
# instead - status checks are still required and direct pushes to the branch
# are still blocked, only the "someone else must approve" step is dropped.
# This is a reasonable default even for public repos: merge/auto-merge is
# already gated by write access, which forks and outside contributors don't
# have, so dropping the approval count doesn't hand out any new capability -
# it only removes friction for pushers who already had it.
